## Introduction

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is widely used in DevOps workflows to ensure application reliability and scalability.

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a system that helps manage applications that are packaged in containers (such as Docker). It allows you to deploy these applications across multiple machines, scale them up or down as needed, and handle failures automatically.

Instead of manually managing each container, Kubernetes does this for you using predefined configurations and automation. It groups containers into logical units called Pods and manages them efficiently.
 ## EXAMPLE-
Imagine you have a toy store, and you have many different kinds of toys (apps). You want to make sure your toys are always available to customers, even if some of them break or go missing. Kubernetes (K8s) is like a magic toy organizer that keeps all your toys in order, replaces broken ones, and makes sure everything runs smoothly! üèóÔ∏èüé†

## Why Kubernetes?

- **Automated Deployment & Scaling**: Helps deploy applications and scale them based on demand.
- **Self-healing**: Restarts failed containers, replaces and reschedules them when necessary.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes network traffic efficiently.
- **Storage Orchestration**: Manages storage needs dynamically.
- **Secret & Configuration Management**: Handles sensitive data securely.

## Prerequisites

To run Kubernetes, you need:

- **Basic Knowledge**: Understanding of containers (Docker), Linux commands, and networking.
- **System Requirements**:
  - Minimum **2 CPU cores** and **4GB RAM** (8GB recommended).
  - At least **20GB free disk space**.
- **Required Tools**:
  1. Docker (for containerized applications)
  2. kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool)
  3. Minikube or Kind (for local cluster setup)

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

### 2. Install kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
kubectl version --client
```

### 3. Install Minikube (For Local Cluster)

```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
minikube start
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

## Basic Kubernetes Concepts

- **Pods**: The smallest unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- **Deployments**: Manages the deployment and scaling of Pods.
- **Services**: Exposes Pods as network services internally or externally.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to services using HTTP/HTTPS.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Stores configuration data securely
